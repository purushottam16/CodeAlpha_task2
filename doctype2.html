Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code and Python
Install VS Code:

Go to the VS Code download page and install it for your operating system.
Install Python:

If Python is not installed, download and install it from the official Python website.
Verify Python Installation: Open your terminal (Command Prompt or VS Code integrated terminal) and type:

bash
Copy
python --version
You should see the installed Python version.

Install Python extension in VS Code:

Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code.
Search for Python and click Install on the Python extension by Microsoft.
Step 2: Set Up the Project in VS Code
Create a New Folder for Your Project:

Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store the chatbot project (e.g., faq-chatbot).
Open VS Code and Open the Folder:

Open VS Code.
Go to File > Open Folder and select the folder you just created.
Create a New Python File:

Inside VS Code, click on File > New File.
Save it as chatbot.py in the opened folder.
Step 3: Write the Code for the Chatbot
Write the chatbot code: Copy and paste the following Python code into chatbot.py:
python
Copy
faq = {
    "what are your business hours?": "Our business hours are Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 6 PM.",
    "where are you located?": "We are located at 123 Main St, Springfield.",
    "how can I contact customer support?": "You can contact customer support at support@example.com or call us at (123) 456-7890.",
    "do you offer international shipping?": "Yes, we offer international shipping to most countries.",
    "what is your return policy?": "We offer a 30-day return policy on all products.",
    "how can I track my order?": "You can track your order using the tracking number sent to your email."
}

def chatbot():
    print("Welcome to the Customer Support Chatbot. Type 'exit' to end.")
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").lower()
        if user_input == 'exit':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        response = faq.get(user_input, "Sorry, I don't have an answer for that.")
        print(f"Bot: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()
Step 4: Run the Program
Open the Integrated Terminal in VS Code:

In VS Code, click Terminal in the top menu and select New Terminal.
Run the Python File:

In the terminal, make sure you're in the project folder where chatbot.py is saved.
Run the chatbot program by typing the following command:
bash
Copy
python chatbot.py
Interact with the Chatbot:

The chatbot will ask for user input. You can type any of the FAQ questions (like "what are your business hours?") and get a response.
To end the conversation, type exit.
Step 5: Testing and Debugging
Test FAQ Responses:

Try typing the questions listed in the faq dictionary (e.g., "where are you located?") to see the chatbot respond.
Handle Unrecognized Inputs:

If you type something that is not in the faq dictionary, the chatbot will respond with "Sorry, I don't have an answer for that.".
Debug if Necessary:

If there are any issues, check for any errors in the terminal and fix the code accordingly. The code should be simple, so errors are usually related to syntax.
Step 6: Customize and Extend the Chatbot (Optional)
Add More FAQ Questions:

You can expand the faq dictionary by adding more common questions and responses.
Handle Variations in Input:

Right now, the program only responds to exact questions. To make it more flexible, you could add code to normalize or match similar questions using regular expressions.
Create a GUI (Optional):

If you want to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for your chatbot, you can use Tkinter or PyQt for a more user-friendly experience.
Step 7: Commit to GitHub (Optional)
Initialize a Git Repository:

In the terminal, initialize a new Git repository by running:
bash
Copy
git init
Add Files to Git:

Stage the files for commit:
bash
Copy
git add .
Commit the Files:

Commit the files:
bash
Copy
git commit -m "Initial commit for FAQ chatbot"
Push to GitHub:

Create a new repository on GitHub and follow the instructions to push your code to GitHub.
Conclusion
At this point, you have created a simple FAQ chatbot in Python using VS Code. The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined questions and answers stored in a dictionary. You can further customize and expand the bot as needed.
